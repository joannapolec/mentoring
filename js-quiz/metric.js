/* 
This function should accept two arguments:
1. `vector1` (= [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n])
2. `vector2` (= [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n])
both of them are arrays of numbers (see vector.js). The function should return the following formulae:
(|x_1 - y_1|^n + |x_2 - y_2|^n + ... + |x_n - y_n|^n)^(1/n)
where n is the length of both of these vectors.

Notation: 2^3 = 2*2*2 (it's a power notation)
2^(1/3) = âˆ›2 (it's a root notation)

E.g. metric([2, 3, 4], [6, 7, 8]) = (|2 - 6|^3 + |3 - 7|^3 + |4 - 8|^3)^(1/3) should return about 5.7689982812
